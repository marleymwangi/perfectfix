                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Are you beating the Bookies regularly? If not, it means you aren't armed with the essential quality soccer predictions data you need! Our data (presented in colorful and easy-to-understand tables, graphs and charts) gives you an incredibly good idea of how both teams in each match are expected to perform. No other website does that - and certainly not in the great and unique way we do it! And it saves you doing countless boring hours of research work each week! As well as predictions that hit the actual score-line or get pretty close thereto for many matches, we also produce a fabulous interactive soccer predictions analysis tool, plus a downloadable that allows you to create great accumulator betting selections for Correct Scores betting (or any other type of soccer betting you fancy)! If you aren't using the quality soccer predictions data we provide, then you can only expect to keep losing to the Bookies. So why don't you take a look at what we offerbefore you bounce away? You won’t regret it!</p>

                    <h2 class="g-font-size-32--xs g-font-size-36--sm g-margin-b-25--xs">A WINNER - YOUR BRAIN + OUR COMPUTER'S OUTPUT!</h2>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> There may well be nagging doubts at the back of your mind telling you that no computer can produce reliable football predictions. And to a certain extent you would be right, of course - computers can only go so far. However, properly programmed and fed the right data, computers can give you a very good indication as to what ought to happen in a given soccer match.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">For sure, using computer-generated output still requires you to take into account all the many issues that could swing the game one way or the other on the day, such as your knowledge of the actual team line-ups. But not using good quality computer-generated output when it is readily available - and at an affordable price - doesn’t make any sense at all!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> Think about this too: even if you currently don’t use a “conventional” electronic computer to do your football betting selections for you, you are probably using nature’s computer – your very own brain!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Nothing stops you – and nor should it – from continuing to use your brain when analysing the output from a computer. Using the combined power of both analytical processes together (brain plus computer) will assuredly give you the best possible advantage, and it is what we encourage you to do.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Our computer-generated statistics give you truly relevant and accurate output data in far greater detail, and to a far higher degree of accuracy, than any human being could ever achieve within the same time frame. As a direct result of this, the data we post on our website gives even the cleverest soccer Bettor tremendous insight when it comes to selecting winning bets. And isn’t that just what you want?</p>

                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Because the Bookies are in business to take your money, you can be sure that they do everything they possibly can to get the biggest possible advantage over you. The "built-in" advantage is called the "house edge" in casinos and takes the form of a mark-up ("Over-Round") for soccer betting, which goes on top of the advantage they already have with their highly specialist soccer betting knowledge. So it is obvious that you need to do everything in your power to start clawing back some advantage to offset that enormous advantage the Bookie would otherwise automatically have over you!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">The first thing you need to do is ask yourself what it is you prefer to bet on, and then check to see if OUR past performance is better than YOURS in those particular areas. If, over the long term, you are truly doing better than we are for your preferred betting scenarios, then you obviously don't need our Services!</p>

                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> To help you realise just how useful our Services could be to you, consider what you would need to do – and the time it would take you – to search out, by yourself, all the information you would need to answer the simple question as to "Which team is most likely to win this soccer match?"</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">First of all, what information would you require? If it were as simple as looking at each team’s relative standing in the tables, then we would all be winners most of the time! But you know that some teams are more erratic than others, and that it’s impossible to work out which teams those are just by looking at the tables.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> If you collected all the match details for each team and listed out how they had performed, that would not be much help to you either! What you really need to know is how you thought each team ought to have performed in each match to date (based on some sort of realistic yardstick), compared to how they actually performed. To do that would prove far harder than you can imagine!</p>

                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">There will always be surprise results when predicting the outcome of soccer matches, because that's the very nature of the Beautiful Game. However, there are many who believe that "unpredictability" is the very ingredient which makes the game so exciting to watch, and possibly the prime reason it has become the number one spectator sport across the globe.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Of course, if you are betting on the outcome - as millions of people around the world do each and every match day - then it can sometimes be a very frustrating sport, as well as being painful for the pocket!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">With our quality data, due diligence checking is made very easy! And we cater for a wide range of different members, from those who want to dissect every piece of information to those in a hurry, and from the seasoned Bettor to the newly initiated. This could never be achieved with a “one-size-fits-all” solution, and that is the principal reason as to why there is a ton of data on our website! However, cross-checking the data from one type of betting "call type" to another will help solidify the confidence in your due diligence findings</p>

                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> The problem with 1X2 betting is that, if you want to make even a 5% profit in a week gambling on "Favourites", then you need to get at least 90% of your bets correct - and many weeks you will need to be 100% right! That's because the Bookies employ highly skilled personnel to make sure it is impossible for the average Bettor to break the bank!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> Further, one Draw will probably occur in every 4-5 "Favourites" bets placed, so achieving a 90% "hit rate" is very nearly impossible, and 100% successes week-after-week for a full season would be nothing short of a miracle!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> If you are a novice, the consequence of this is that - like millions of others in the same situation as you - at the end of a season of "Favourites" betting your Starting Bank is probably less than half of what you started with!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> Yes, for sure, even novices can have a lucky day or two! And that's what drives most gamblers. But have all YOUR past lucky days made up for the combined losses on the days your luck failed you?</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> It is possible to make money with 1X2 betting season after season, but to do so you need to rise well above the level of novice.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> Having access to our predictions data dramatically turns the tide in your favour, not just for 1X2 betting but for Correct Scores betting too!</p>

Nothing is hidden from you, because we feel you need – and deserve – to be made fully aware of the full picture before laying out your hard-earned cash on any soccer betting.</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> We give you exactly what you need from a Perfectfix Prediction Service: a Proven Winning System – Packed with Essential Facts – all for an Outstandingly Low Price! And as we said before, we challenge you to find anything as good as our Soccer Prediction System anywhere else on the Internet, or find any Soccer Prediction website as open and honest with you as we are, or as comprehensive in its information/data coverage as we are. We know that you simply won't be able to do it!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm">Of course, you will have to be honest with yourself about how your own predictions fared when looking at our Program's outputs, and see if you could truly come up with results as good (and score-lines as close) as ours have proved to be. We bet you wouldn’t have done half as well as us overall!</p>
                    <p class="g-font-size-18--sm"> So, now you have validated for yourself that our website really is as good as we say it is, take the one step necessary to turn yourself into a winner from today: subscribe to our unrivalled Services!</p>
